# Study the solvers
## Instructions

In this lesson you learned about the various solvers that pair algorithms with a machine learning process to create an accurate model. Walk through the solvers listed in the lesson and pick two. In your own words, compare and contrast these two solvers. What kind of problem do they address? How do they work with various data structures? Why would you pick one over another?
