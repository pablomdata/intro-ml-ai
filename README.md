## Setup 

- You need Python 3.11 installed in your system.
- Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/pablomdata/intro-ml-ai```
- Go to the folder in the command prompt. Once there, use the command
```python -m venv env```
to create a virtual environment.
- Activate the virtual environment:
	- In Windows: `env\Scripts\activate.bat`
	- In Mac/Linux: `source env/scripts/activate`
You should see an `(env)` next to your prompt.
- Install dependencies:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Launch Jupyter notebook:
```jupyter notebook```
